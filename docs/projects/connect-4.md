# Connect 4

!!! note

    ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

## Goals

1. Create an AI that is able to beat me on Connect 4 game
2. Learn from the AI what is the best policy
3. Compare model-free and [model-based](../artificial-intelligence/model-based-rl.md) algorithms on this game

## Motivation

When I play Connect 4 I tipically place my first pieces in the center. I don't know if that is the
best policy and I would like to know it. I believe it will be fun to create a superhuman AI for this
game and hopefully I will learn something.

## About the game

Let's first read about the game to see if it solved. From the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

> Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

So we can see that the game has been solved.

> For classic Connect Four played on a 7-column-wide, 6-row-high grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 positions (4.5e12) for all game boards populated with 0 to 42 pieces.

The state space is very big, so we cannot store a value table.

> The solved conclusion for Connect Four is first-player-win. With perfect play, the first player can force a win, on or before the 41st move by starting in the middle column.

Let's see if we can get an agent close to the optimum.

## Environment

We need to find an environment where we can train the agents and also play against them.
