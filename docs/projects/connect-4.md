# Connect 4

!!! note

    ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

## Goals

1. Create an AI that is able to beat me on Connect 4 game
2. Learn from the AI what is the best policy
3. Compare model-free and [model-based](../artificial-intelligence/model-based-rl.md) algorithms on this game

## Motivation

When I play Connect 4 I tipically place my first pieces in the center. I don't know if that is the
best policy and I would like to know it. I believe it will be fun to create a superhuman AI for this
game and hopefully I will learn something.

## About the game

Let's first read about the game to see if it solved.
