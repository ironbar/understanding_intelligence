# High level functions of the brain

To be able to understand and recreate intelligence it is important to know which
are the functions done by the brain.

## Perception

> Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information or environment.[^1]

Perception might be the brain function that it is currently best done by artificial intelligence. There are many models that can predict which objects are present
on a image.

## Language

> A language is a structured system of communication. The structure of a language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Languages are the primary means of communication of humans, and can be conveyed through speech (spoken language), sign, or writing. [^2]

The Transformer architecture has recently allowed to create very powerful language models like GPT3 and Palm.

## Memory

> Memory is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. [^3]

Language models like GPT3 have memorized part of the data they were trained on. However that is very
different from human memory. Recurrent models have also some working memory that can modify their
behaviour. I believe there is a big gap in this area between the brain and artificial neural networks.

### Short-term memory

TODO

### Long-term memory

TODO

## Planning

> Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal. Planning is based on foresight, the fundamental capacity for mental time travel. The evolution of forethought, the capacity to think ahead, is considered to have been a prime mover in human evolution. Planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior. It involves the use of logic and imagination to visualise not only a desired end result, but the steps necessary to achieve that result. [^4]

To be able to plan a model of the world is needed. The human brain is always making predictions about
what are we going to experience and if something is different to the prediction attention is risen.
This constant predictions are done unconsciously and continuously.

I have the believe that this mechanism of prediction of future events could be a very powerful
signal to learn useful features for perception.

## Attention

## Judgment

## Decision-making

## Emotion

## Motor skills
