# Why do we have to sleep

When we sleep we are almost disconnected from the external world, we do not process the information of our senses.
It seems that this time is used by the brain to consolidate new memories. It may look that the brain is finding an
equilibrium to maintain old memories while adding the new ones (to avoid catastrophical forgetting).

I find interesting that the younger the person the more sleep it needs. This is specially obvious in babies
where they have to sleep many times a day.
