# Question Answering

## Intro

On this page I want to study the state of the art of the question answering systems. I believe that a
system that could answer correctly to questions about a document or a website will be very valuable.
It would be a very useful tool for knowledge management, we could simply add knowledge to a website
and then query the question answering model when we need it.

On a small scale it would be useful for companies. It would "replace" that person in the company that
knows everything.

On a big scale it could replace Google and help advance scientific discovery.

## Open questions

I have written a list of questions that I have at the start of this study that I would like to
answer.

### How good are big language models at question answering?

Remember that they typically train for one epoch so they don't memorize the dataset.

### What if we simply fine-tune a big model in our data?

### Can we decouple data and model?

### Blenderbot

### Could we create a knowledge graph a la Google style?

### How do humans do this task of question answering?

### Is the system scalable? (to challenge Google)

### Are there commercial or open-source solutions?

No paid traffic on Google
