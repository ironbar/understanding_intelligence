# Model Based Reinforcement Learning

# 🚧 Work in progress 🚧

## Motivation

In the past I have followed [DeepMind's RL course](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-lecture-series-2018) and know I'm doing the [Hugginface's RL course](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class) to remember the concepts. However they do not dig deep into model based
RL and that's what I want to do it now.

In [Sutton and Barto](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) book I cannot find either anything about model based RL.

I believe world models will play a big role in the road of AGI. Without a world
model is not possible to plan, so we need them to achieve complex thinking and
reasoning.

## Resources

Let's search for learning resources and list them to prioritize them.
